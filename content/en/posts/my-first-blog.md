## Hello, I am Xiong Xinwei.

In the river of time, I'm so honored to step into this significant moment of my senior year. More than just a student, I'm passionate about writing those pulsating codes. Hence, I became an avid follower of open source. Welcome to explore my digital realmâ€”[My GitHub](https://github.com/cubxxw). Here, you will witness my love for technology, my third-generation blog, and I hope it becomes the ultimate link for my conversation with the world.

Among countless communities, [OpenIM](http://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server) stands out like the shining Polaris, guiding me forward, nourishing my tech-savvy heart, and inspiring me to take real actions.

However, my life doesn't merely revolve around the screen. **From now on, the world is no longer a book, but the vast land unfolding beneath my feet**. The call of the outdoors delights me. Whether it's my solo adventures or merry gatherings with friends, every step is a tribute to nature and an exploration of life.

I seek the profound meaning of open source and continuously get insights from reading:

+ **"The Road to Open Source Success"**: It made me realize that every success is not accidental but a reward for the thorn-covered paths trodden.
+ **"The Cathedral and the Bazaar"**: Open source isn't just about code sharing; it's about heart-to-heart communication and a pursuit of freedom and innovation.
+ **"Hackers and Painters"**: This piece remains my favorite to this day, reminding me that true value lies not in what you have, but in what you create.

**> "Your value depends on what you create, not what you possess."**

This saying is my daily mantra, motivating me to keep moving forward and create my own wonders.

To me, open source is a journey filled with the unknown and challenges. Yet, I yearn to meet more fellow travelers on this path, to share and co-create with you.

I sincerely invite you to join me in exploring this world full of possibilities.
