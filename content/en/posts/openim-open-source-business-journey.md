## Introduction: Global Perspective at the Shenzhen Futian Convention and Exhibition Center

On December 6, 2023, the GTC 2023 Global Traffic Conference was held in full swing at the Shenzhen Futian Convention and Exhibition Center. This grand event brought together technology elites from around the world to explore the cutting-edge trends and future developments in the internet industry. As a participant, I had the privilege of immersing myself in this exchange between technology and business, particularly the theme of "Focusing on Open Source and Pioneering Global Expansion," which left a profound impression on me.

The conference focused on diverse global topics, including market expansion and advertising strategies for going global, similar to activities I had previously participated in, which focused on entering the Japanese market. However, this conference allowed me to delve into the open-source community for the first time, where I not only met many leaders and advocates of the open-source community but also exchanged insights with numerous outstanding developers. Through these exchanges, I not only gained a wealth of new knowledge but also experienced personal growth in my thinking.

In this blog post, I will deeply reflect on and summarize this unique experience, sharing my insights and learning from the intersection of open source and globalization.

**For OpenIM, we are currently preparing to enter international markets with full force, hoping to break down borders and contribute OpenIM's user-friendly and free open-source core features to developers worldwide.**

Open source projects are inherently based on distributed collaboration, which is a loose structure. Take OpenIM developers as an example: we currently have many contributors and developers, and while the community holds bi-weekly meetings, it is still challenging to have in-depth discussions with colleagues or peers.

However, for open-source commercial companies, this remote work model is not always sufficient. In commercial companies, collaboration is often closer, and there is a higher demand for timeliness. Face-to-face communication is more effective in ensuring the integrity of information transfer, which remote work cannot entirely replace. Of course, remote work has its advantages, such as attracting talent from around the world.

Therefore, open-source commercial companies can adopt remote collaboration, but it is essential to ensure sufficient and effective communication, leveling the playing field:

+ Video communication should be prioritized, with written communication reserved for final documentation. Video communication minimizes information loss during remote discussions and is the preferred method for remote work communication. Avoid using text to discuss non-technical issues, as it can lead to significant information gaps and misunderstandings.
+ Ensure respect and goodwill in communication. In open-source projects, contributors participate voluntarily, without employment relationships, so respect and goodwill are emphasized during asynchronous communication. In remote work in commercial companies, where there is a lack of communication, venting, and psychological support among colleagues, it is even more critical to pay attention to respectful communication.
+ Regular in-person meetings to increase mutual understanding and trust.

Another point to consider in long-term remote collaboration, for participating engineers, is the need for high levels of self-discipline and self-management. It is also important to maintain a healthy work-life balance and engage in social activities and physical fitness to avoid becoming disconnected from society.

I had a deep conversation with a colleague from Apache APISIX before. She mentioned something that left a deep impression on me. Many colleagues who couldn't adapt to remote work eventually left, which is a Darwinian law of survival for those who can adapt.

For more information on OpenIM's remote work culture and corporate culture, I highly recommend reading the following blog posts:

## Going Global Challenge: The Globalization Journey of Chinese Internet Companies

The exploration of global markets by Chinese internet companies is filled with challenges and opportunities. From initial attempts to enter overseas markets to survival in a fiercely competitive international environment, these companies are continually seeking growth opportunities in new market environments. During this process, companies need to transcend traditional business models and adapt to diverse cultures and market demands.

**First, let's address the question: Why build an overseas community?**

After communicating and reflecting with many advocates and experts in the open-source community, I firmly believe that establishing an active overseas community is crucial for the success of an open-source project. In today's globalized world, open source is not just about sharing code; it is also about the exchange of culture and ideas. By establishing overseas communities, we can not only bring technology to every corner of the world but also promote the collision of thoughts and innovation in different cultural backgrounds.

In a humane sense, building an overseas community means establishing broader connections and resonances. Every open-source contributor, regardless of their location, wants their voice to be heard and their contributions to be recognized. An overseas community provides a platform for developers from around the world to participate in projects, share their unique perspectives and experiences. This diverse participation not only enriches the project itself but also ignites more sparks of innovation.

Moreover, the establishment of overseas communities is a tribute to the open-source spirit. The open-source spirit emphasizes openness, collaboration, and sharing, and these values are universal worldwide. As we expand overseas, we are not only sharing code but also spreading the spirit of inclusiveness and cooperation.

Furthermore, for open-source projects, the establishment of overseas communities means access to broader markets and usage scenarios. Different regions and cultural backgrounds may have vastly different technology needs and application methods. These diverse inputs are indispensable for the project's development and help it grow comprehensively to better serve global users.

**I started using GitHub from my freshman year, and it has been the key to unlocking my future.**

Around 2020, I began to engage with open source and found it more meaningful than proprietary code. Open source not only involves technical accumulation but also allows you to share what you've learned with others and grow together. So, for programmers, open source is a win-win.

At the beginning, I started by taking notes and sharing them on GitHub. Later, I worked on projects and got involved in top open-source projects, gradually pursuing excellence. Throughout this process, I could see my personal growth clearly.

Even my code, like the Merkle tree structure of Git or blockchain, was recorded step by step. Whenever I look back at my past pull requests, they are filled with memories and nostalgia...

**Similarly, I am also a enthusiast of cloud native technology.**

In today's era, open source has become an irreversible trend, especially in the field of cloud native technology. Take Microsoft, for example; they are among the top contributors to open-source projects on GitHub, demonstrating their comprehensive embrace of open source. In the era of cloud native, if you do not embrace open source and utilize open-source components to build and optimize your core systems, you may fall behind in the competitive market. The rapid development of cloud native technology requires companies and developers to adapt quickly to new technologies and methodologies, and open-source communities are incubators for this innovation and collaboration. In this era, open source is not just a technical choice; it is also a necessary strategic mindset.

## Internationalization Choices for Open Source Communities: Setting Sail for the First Stop

**United States: Leading the Development of Open Source** The United States remains the largest developer community globally, with over 20 million developers, experiencing a 21% growth in the past year. The open-source community in the United States has a long and mature history, and it is a significant driver of open-source activities worldwide.

**Asia-Pacific Region: Rapidly Growing Stars** The Asia-Pacific region, especially India, Japan, and Singapore, is experiencing significant growth in open-source communities. India's developer community growth is particularly remarkable, and it is expected to surpass the United States by 2027, becoming the world's largest open-source community.

**Africa: Emerging Markets with Great Potential** Various regions in Africa, especially Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya, are rapidly developing into hubs for technology companies. The number of developers in these regions is significantly increasing every year.

**South America: A Vigorous and Growing Region** South America's developer community, especially in Argentina and Brazil, continues to expand at a pace similar to that of Asia-Pacific and Africa.

**Europe: Stable Growth in Mature Markets** Although the growth rate of Europe's open-source community is slower than that of the United States, countries like Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom still maintain stable growth.

## Open Source Technology: A New Force Driving the Internationalization of Chinese Enterprises

Open source technology has played a crucial role in the internationalization process of Chinese internet companies. By adopting open source technology, businesses not only gain flexibility and increased innovation speed but also promote cross-cultural technical exchange and collaboration. This is essential for rapidly adapting to the diverse global markets, maintaining technological advancement, and competitiveness.

### Overseas Promotion Strategy

For Chinese companies, using popular overseas technology media and tech blogs for content promotion is an effective method. This not only increases international exposure but also helps in building brand image and attracting the attention of global users and tech communities.

#### Recommended Overseas Tech Media Platforms:

+ **TechCrunch**: A globally renowned tech media outlet focusing on tech news and emerging technologies.
+ **Hacker Noon**: A platform focusing on tech stories, programming, and entrepreneurship.
+ **Hashnode**: A tech blog community that allows developers to create and share their blogs.
+ **Dzone**: A knowledge-sharing community for tech professionals.
+ **InfoQ**: A platform for tech news and knowledge sharing aimed at software developers, architects, and project managers.
+ **OpenSource.com**: An online media outlet dedicated to open source technology and applications.

#### Recommended Overseas Social Media Platforms:

+ **Twitter**: A platform with a large global user base, suitable for promotion and brand building.
+ **Facebook**: The world's largest social networking platform, covering a wide user base.
+ **Stack Overflow**: The world's largest programmer Q&A community, suitable for tech discussions and promotion.

+ **Hacker News**: Operated by Y Combinator, it focuses on tech and entrepreneurship in the community.
+ **DEV Community**: A community platform for developers to connect and learn.

#### Of course, the most important

**Ⓜ️ Apart from the above, I believe that the website and documentation of the open source community are the most worthwhile places to invest.**

One of the most important insights in open-source projects is that they require strong PR efforts, but not in the traditional sense of publishing thousands of articles. Instead, it requires extensive communication with developers, such as organizing meetings and conferences to facilitate face-to-face communication. Contributors and their submitted pull requests don't just appear out of thin air; they need encouragement and support.

Releasing the most challenging and hardcore aspects of open source projects and having more people in the community use them is what leads to higher stability.

For startups in China, with limited manpower and few success stories, customers may worry about the sustainability of their products and services. In simpler terms, if I buy your product, will your company go out of business in two years, leaving me with an unsupported product? Open-source projects face fewer cultural barriers and have higher acceptance in the European and American markets. However, in China, open-source commercial companies are a relatively new concept, and the acceptance of this model is not very high. It may take some time or successful cases to prove its viability.

## Commercial Exploration: Balancing Open Source and Profit Models

However, the balance between open source and commercialization is a challenge that companies have to face. Finding a model that ensures both technological openness and revenue generation through value-added services, technical support, or custom development has become a key issue. Open-source software's biggest challenge is balancing economic value with the enthusiasm and motivation of the open-source community.

Economic value is a necessary condition for open-source software to have a significant impact, but it must be balanced with the interests of the open-source community. Given this, it is important to find strategies that maximize the benefits for both sides of the equation.

### The Shift in Open Source Ideals is the First Step in the Growth of Open Source Developers

**Two visible eras:**

+ Open Source 1.0 - The Era of Support and Services
+ Open Source 2.0 - The Era of Software as a Service and Open Core

In examining the history and evolution of the open-source movement, we can see that the shift in open-source ideals is not only a natural trend in technological development but also a crucial step in the growth of open-source developers. Starting from the early era of support and services (Open Source 1.0), open-source software demonstrated its significant value to enterprises and core technology development. Since the emergence of Linux in 1991, open-source technology has gradually become an effective path for building foundational software. Particularly since the creation of the term "open source" by the Open Source Initiative in 1998, open-source communities and commercial entities have begun to explore hybrid business models. Notable examples include RedHat and MySQL, which achieved sustainability by providing paid support and services on top of free software.

However, it is worth noting that early open-source companies often lagged behind their proprietary counterparts in terms of valuation. A clear comparison, such as RedHat versus Microsoft or MySQL versus Oracle, vividly illustrates the initial underestimation of the economic value of open-source software by the industry. By the mid-2000s, with the rise of cloud computing, this valuation perception began to fundamentally change. The advent of Software as a Service (SaaS) and the Open Core model (Open Source 2.0) made deploying open-source software in cloud environments commonplace. User focus on the open or proprietary nature of software gradually decreased. This not only brought the valuations of open source and proprietary companies closer but also highlighted the real economic and strategic value of open-source software.

Furthermore, a series of acquisitions of open-source startups by large tech companies, such as Citrix's acquisition of XenSource and Sun's acquisition of MySQL, pushed open-source software into the core of the tech industry. Interestingly, even Microsoft, which once referred to Linux as a "cancer," now widely uses open-source software in its tech stack and invests heavily in many open-source projects. This trend suggests that future open-source startups are likely to emerge from large tech companies, much like they originated from academic research labs or developers' garages, marking the maturity of open-source ideals and the growth and progress of open-source developers.

**I attempted to read and found some evaluations of community commercialization on Douban or other platforms. I discovered that open source in this era has become a driving force for commercialization, and they complement each other.**

1. "The Cathedral & the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond:

   + Excerpt: "In the open-source model, software development resembles a large marketplace (bazaar) with various agendas and goals. This model is more suitable for today's rapidly changing world as it encourages rapid evolution of technology and strategies."
   + The book uses metaphor to reveal the characteristics of open-source software development, emphasizing how open-source communities foster innovation and rapid responses to market demands, providing an ideal environment for commercialization.

2. "Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project" by Karl Fogel:

   + Excerpt: "Successful open-source projects require not only excellent coding skills but also wise management. This includes understanding the needs of users and contributors and how to translate these needs into commercial success."

   + This book explores how to run a successful open-source project from a management perspective, highlighting the challenges and opportunities open

   + source projects face in achieving commercialization.

     1. **"Free Software, Free Society: Selected Essays of Richard M. Stallman" by Richard M. Stallman**:
        + Excerpt: "The free software movement is not just about technology but also about ethics, freedom, and community rights. Commercialization of open source should respect these principles to ensure that software freedom is not eroded by commercial interests."
        + Stallman's essays emphasize the societal and ethical values of free software, providing a deeper ethical perspective on the commercialization of open-source software.
     2. **"Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution" by Chris DiBona, Sam Ockman, Mark Stone**:
        + Excerpt: "The open-source revolution is not just an innovation in technology but also in business models. It proves that in an open and collaborative environment, business interests can coexist with community contributors."
        + This book compiles the viewpoints of several open-source pioneers, showcasing how open source creates new collaboration models and value propositions in the business world.
     3. **"Open Source for Business: A Practical Guide to Open Source Software Licensing" by Heather Meeker**:
        + Excerpt: "In open-source projects, the choice of licenses is crucial. The right licensing strategy can protect the interests of developers while attracting commercial investment for sustainable development."
        + This book focuses on the practical aspects of open-source software licensing, providing practical guidance on how to protect open-source projects while achieving commercialization.

     **When you truly operate and evangelize a top-notch open-source project, you'll realize that the least important thing in open source is the number of stars.**

     The major overhaul of OpenIM started from version 3.0, around June 7, 2023. I joined OpenIM as an intern and, in just six months, was responsible for community operations, development, testing, maintenance, automation, and more. I submitted over a hundred PRs and raised over a hundred issues. I standardized the entire OpenIM community and enforced open-source standards. I contributed to 1/3 of the PRs and 1/6 of the issues. I established Slack and bi-weekly meetings. I also witnessed the transformation of OpenIM from a quiet, uncontributed, and challenging community to a thriving one.

     I deeply understand that star counts cannot be used as a measure of an open-source project's success. I forgot OpenIM's star count during this process, focusing on building community **activity**. **Activity is the only metric for measuring an open-source project's success**.

     When evaluating and choosing open-source projects, while the star count on GitHub is an intuitive metric, it can be influenced by various factors such as project age, commercial promotion activities, or even cheating. Therefore, even projects with a high star count may lack continuous maintenance once they achieve their initial key performance indicators (KPIs).

     A more reasonable metric is GitHub's "pulse" feature. This built-in feature provides a transparent view of project activity for everyone, such as OpenIM Server. By examining monthly activity statistics, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of a project's activity and maintenance status. You can view this data here: [OpenIM Server Activity Statistics](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/pulse). I recommend reading and analyzing this information for a more accurate evaluation.

     > Excluding merges, **5 authors** have pushed **8 commits** to main and **13 commits** to all branches. On main, **167 files** have changed and there have been [**4,367** **additions** and **6,017** **deletions**](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/compare/0efc235f45377d997d283557b1f61acf922f9ab3...main).

     + You can see from the link above how many PRs OpenIM has submitted recently and how many issues it has resolved. It's clear that this is a healthy, active open-source project. I found another project with a high star count but, in the same one-month period, had no merged pull requests and only resolved one issue, indicating that it is in a dormant state. Choosing a dormant project means that when you encounter problems, you'll have to rely on yourself to resolve them and won't receive effective support from the community, which is not what we want.
     + Additionally, we can examine the diversity of contributors. Are most contributors from the same company, or are they distributed across multiple companies? Are pull requests mainly contributed by a few top contributors, or are they relatively evenly distributed? You can get more information on this in ossinsight: https://ossinsight.io/analyze/openimsdk/open-im-server
     + Quality matters in pull requests and issues. Besides the obvious quantity, quality is also essential. Do pull requests mainly address documentation, comments, typos, or core code and features? Can issues accurately describe and reproduce bugs? These aspects reflect the quality of the entire community of contributors and the leadership of the community leaders.
     + You can find some referring sites and popular content on https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/graphs/traffic. This provides insights into the traffic flow to and from OpenIM.

     **Of course, OpenIM still has some areas for improvement, such as the election of committers and PMC.**

     We have a version release management mechanism, but we don't have a well-defined process for electing committers and PMC members.

     For some top open-source projects, such as those under Apache and CNCF, all PMC members have equal rights, with no dictators. Your influence in the community is amplified by your contributions.

     **Another challenge is that OpenIM lacks endorsement from major companies and does not have the support of top foundations like Apache and CNCF. How can it build a top-tier community?**

     Building a top-tier community for an open-source project like OpenIM that lacks endorsement from major companies or support from top foundations is indeed a challenge. However, by adopting a series of strategies and methods, OpenIM can effectively establish and grow its community.

     First and foremost, it's crucial to create a top-tier, high-quality project. The community should take precedence over the code, although the code remains central. Clearly define the project's vision and goals and communicate with potential contributors and users to attract like-minded individuals.

     Similarly, OpenIM's philosophy is to establish an open, inclusive, and friendly community culture that encourages contributors of all levels to participate. We also provide clear entry guides and support for newcomers.

     In community management, maintaining an active presence is key. This includes promptly responding to issues, merging pull requests, and providing feedback. Organizing regular bi-weekly meetings, online forums, and community events fosters communication and collaboration.

     Transparency is vital during the project's development process. Open discussions, roadmaps, and decision-making processes should be made public. Use tools like GitHub, social media, blogs, and mailing lists to facilitate communication and information sharing.

     Furthermore, providing comprehensive and understandable documentation and tutorials helps users and new contributors better understand and use the project.

     Additionally, recognizing and appreciating the work of developers and contributors is essential. This can be done through contributor rankings, mentioning contributors' work, or other forms of recognition (e.g., small community-related gifts).



## Collaboration and Innovation: A Business Strategy of Working Together

In the wave of globalization, establishing strong partnerships has become increasingly crucial. Companies need to not only excel in technology but also innovate together with their partners in terms of business models and market strategies. By joining forces, they can better navigate market changes and carve out new opportunities.

The importance of collaboration is evident, but successful collaboration relies on several key factors, especially in the context of open-source community projects. Firstly, the quality of the project is foundational. A project that excels in technology and addresses specific issues is more likely to attract partners. Additionally, the user base of the project is crucial. A project with a large user base signifies a clear demand in the market, naturally drawing more attention from potential partners.

The influence of founders and core teams should not be underestimated. Their industry standing, technical expertise, and business insights can play a significant role in enhancing the project's reputation and attractiveness. Furthermore, the integrity of founders and teams, including their principles and ethical standards, is essential in building long-term collaborative relationships.

Moreover, the influence and resources of partners are also vital. A strong partner can bring necessary resources such as funding, market channels, customer bases, or specialized skills, all of which are indispensable for project growth.

However, collaboration is not merely a simple accumulation of resources; it involves a deep integration of ideas, technology, and market strategies between both parties. This integration can lead to innovation, open up new market opportunities, and collectively address industry challenges. For example, by jointly developing new products with a partner or entering new markets together, risks can be effectively shared, and both parties can benefit from the collaboration.

**In my career, I have deeply experienced the powerful force of open-source communities and interpersonal networks.** For instance, I participated in the SealOS project during my sophomore year and joined their community. This experience not only allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience but also introduced me to industry experts like Mr. Cui.

Later, when I embarked on deploying OpenIM, I leveraged the connections I had established earlier to collaborate with the SealOS team. This collaboration was mutually beneficial: SealOS provided us with an efficient and reliable deployment solution, while our OpenIM team helped SealOS expand its reach and promotion to a broader user base. Through this cooperative effort, we not only deepened technical exchanges but also explored new market opportunities and business prospects together.

This experience highlights the immense potential of collaboration in open-source communities. In such communities, people share not only code but also insights, experiences, and resources, collectively promoting technological advancement and personal growth. This collaborative approach breaks traditional boundaries of competition and, through the pooling of collective wisdom and resources, creates value beyond individual capabilities.

## Case Study: Chinese Internet Companies' Successful Expansion into Global Markets

During the conference, through a series of successful case studies, we saw how Chinese internet companies achieved breakthroughs in the global market. These companies not only relied on innovative technology but also excelled in precise market positioning and effective international cooperation, enabling them to stand out in fierce competition.

For example, at the Global Traffic Conference (GTC), I had the opportunity to meet members of the Apache APISIX community and the CEO of Whale Open Source. They shared their experiences in building overseas communities.

+ **APISIX**: APISIX not only welcomes contributions in terms of code but also encourages various forms of contributions, such as documentation, event organization, and blogs. This reflects its inclusivity and global community approach. APISIX also has a dedicated team overseas to operate the overseas community, welcoming and assisting overseas customers and developers.
+ **TDengine's Open Source Journey**: TDengine is a successful open-source project that includes opening its core code to increase competitiveness and market influence. The project emphasizes that open-source is not just about writing high-quality code but also involves market promotion and continuous development. The success of open-source projects is believed to depend on community engagement, user numbers, contributor activity, and the project team's professional background and capabilities.
+ **Success Story of OpenMLDB**: The OpenMLDB community was recognized as a healthy case of a Chinese open-source community in 2022, showcasing its success in areas such as project technical iterations, community organizational structure, member composition, open-source governance, upstream and downstream cooperation, community ecosystem, and commercialization. This achievement highlights the importance and influence of the OpenMLDB community in driving the development of domestic open-source communities.

## GTC 2023: Profound Insights and Inspiration

At the Global Traffic Conference (GTC) in 2023, I gained profound insights and valuable inspiration. This platform brought together technological pioneers from around the world to explore the latest trends and challenges in the internet industry. From detailed technical discussions to broad market strategies, every aspect of the conference involved deep reflections on the future of the internet world.

Among the many intriguing topics, several particularly impressed me. Firstly, the discussions on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in open-source projects showcased not only the current boundaries of technology but also outlined potential future directions. Additionally, the discussions on cloud computing and big data processing provided practical knowledge and broadened my perspective, helping me better understand how these technologies shape modern businesses.

I also paid special attention to discussions about cross-cultural collaboration and international market expansion. These topics are crucial for understanding how to find opportunities in diverse global markets. The experiences and strategies shared by experts provided practical guidance for the development of Chinese companies on the international stage.

I understand the significant role that open-source communities play in driving technological innovation and cultural exchange. Open-source projects are not only incubators for technical innovation but also platforms for global cooperation and shared knowledge. **The open-source spirit is not just about sharing code; it is a force that drives global collaboration and understanding.**

## Conclusion: The Path and Challenges of Open-Source Commercialization

After attending GTC 2023, I have a deeper understanding of open-source commercialization. Open-source, once just a buzzword in the programmer's circle, has now become an indispensable force for both businesses and governments. This is not only because it brings technological security, stability, and high performance but also because of the spirit of sharing and collaboration behind it, benefiting every participant.

I see that with the proliferation of open-source solutions, our customers and society as a whole will enjoy better services. This is not just a victory for technology but also a transformation of culture and mindset. The development of open-source software is like an educational revolution, making learning and innovation an open and mutually beneficial process.

China's open-source community is an active participant in this revolution. Here, we not only witness the gradual acceptance of the idea of paying for open-source software by businesses but also the rise of more and more commercial open-source software companies. These companies, like borderless warriors, are not afraid to start in the complex domestic market and bravely seek their place in global competition.

Especially for Chinese open-source projects like Apache APISIX and SupporterTech, I feel a deep sense of pride. They not only showcase the strength of Chinese technology but also serve as significant forces driving global technological innovation and collaboration. I look forward to seeing more Chinese open-source projects like them in the future, going global and contributing to the global internet ecosystem.

So, when we talk about open-source commercialization, we are not just discussing technology; we are talking about a force that can drive the world forward. This is a journey that is both challenging and exciting, and I feel honored to be a part of it.
